# I. Introduction

Yes, it is exactly what you are thinking, another dumb guy that have deviced to reinvent the wheel. Indeed, it might seem a dumb idea but I had my own reasons. You see, I am mostly a self-taught person and most of my conding experience came by reading coding books, reading others people code, and by through trial and error in personal projects. That is exactly the point of this project. The objective is not to compete with other competing projects, it is instead to gather more project development experience by applying my knowledge and understanding on how should a logger work, and try to reach the exact same point that other have already achieved.

This logging library is based on the Python's logging library working mechanisms, which I made use quite a lot for the past year.

I tried to make this library as simple, efficient, and dynamic as possible, for my experience of course. If you are interested to use it, feel free to do so and hope you like it.

# II. Platforms

This library was developed to be used in both Linux and Windows platforms.

However, it has only been tested in the Linux platform. Windows testing will be done as soon as possible.

# III. How to use it

This logging library is very simple to be used. If you want to learn a bit more on the multiple usage cases, please access the examples within the examples directory. There are several comments through the code that should guide you. Have fun!
