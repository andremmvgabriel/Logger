Sao apenas produtos/hardware que se pode comprar para simular?


Drones Simulator -> The best ones are paid, and are not opensource...

[Software] https://www.dji.com/pt/simulator  -> uff

[Software] https://zephyr-sim.com/ -> Zephyr

[GitHub OPENSOURCE!!] https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim -> You would have to understand the code to manage whatever else you want.

Other opensources... But not smelling that good... https://opensource.com/article/18/2/drone-projects


Last resource...
> Develop a simulation on Unity / Unreal Engine 4.
What would this imply? Lots of time developing the scene... Simulating the physics more precisely for more relevant results...
